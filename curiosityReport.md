# 🚀 Research Report: DevOps and QA for C#/.NET Backend API Development

## 📅 Date
April 14, 2025

## 🎯 Objective
To understand and apply **DevOps** and **QA best practices** while learning how to deploy backend APIs using **C#** and the **.NET Framework**, with a focus on integrating CI/CD, testing strategies, and cross-language communication between frontend and backend.

---

## 🛠️ DevOps Responsibilities & Learnings

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Environment Setup** | Created local development and staging environments using `.NET CLI` and Docker. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Learned how to configure CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions** and **Azure DevOps** for automatic testing, building, and deployment of the API. |
| **Containerization** | Built Dockerfiles for .NET API and configured multi-stage builds for optimized images. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Researched use of **Terraform** and **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** templates to provision infrastructure. |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Integrated **Serilog** for logging and explored **Application Insights** for live metrics on Azure. |
| **Secrets Management** | Used **Azure Key Vault** and environment variables to securely manage API keys and database strings. |
| **API Versioning** | Implemented API versioning strategy using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning` for maintainability. |

---

## ✅ QA and Testing Strategy

| QA Area | Key Learning & Implementation |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Wrote unit tests using **xUnit** to test service and controller logic independently. |
| **Integration Testing** | Used `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` to write tests that simulate HTTP calls to API endpoints. |
| **Test Automation** | Integrated tests into GitHub Actions pipeline for automatic validation on push/PR. |
| **Postman Collections** | Created Postman test suites to validate API endpoints manually and as part of a CI process. |
| **Load Testing** | Explored **Apache JMeter** and **k6** for simulating concurrent requests and identifying performance bottlenecks. |
| **API Contract Testing** | Ensured frontend and backend matched using tools like **Swagger/OpenAPI** and tested schema consistency. |

---

## 🌐 Key Technologies and Tools Used

- **.NET 6/7**, ASP.NET Core, C#
- **Docker**, Docker Compose
- **GitHub Actions**, Azure DevOps
- **xUnit**, Postman, Swagger, JMeter
- **Azure App Services**, Azure Key Vault, Application Insights
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** for API contract testing and documentation

---

## 🧩 Challenges & Resolutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Handling deployment secrets securely | Implemented Azure Key Vault and GitHub Secrets |
| Integrating test automation into CI | Used GitHub Actions YAML to run `dotnet test` and Postman tests |
| Making backend accessible from different frontends | Configured proper **CORS** policies and tested cross-origin requests |
| Testing APIs with dependencies (like DB) | Used **test containers** and mocking for isolated tests |

---

## 📈 Outcomes

- ✅ Built an automated pipeline to **build, test, and deploy** a .NET Web API
- ✅ Created test suites for unit, integration, and load testing
- ✅ Ensured API was production-ready with **robust QA coverage**
- ✅ Successfully connected backend to frontend using RESTful architecture
